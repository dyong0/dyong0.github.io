title : Human error

Do you think you can accumulate numbers 1 to 1000 sequentially without any error? You might say Yes, but I never do. It's giving me 1000 times of chances to make a mistake. 1 + 2 = 3, 3 + 4 = 7, 7 + 5 = 12, and so on. Even if I finished calculating it, I may be afraid of saying that the result is correct. Basically I don't have any proof to show even to myself.

What if you get the pressure where you should never make mistakes, but surrounded by unexpected things. You might say that "I got this result, but with imperfect accuracy." You get defensive against making results, you won't be proactive.

Human errors always happen even with being super careful. We should find out a solution to ensure the 100 percent of accuracy. Blaming people who take the responsibilities can't be any solution for this problem. The correct way to prevent human errors is using a system that can be entirely trusted.

Reliable systems are built on the tests, which detect unexpected behaviors and changes. And also you can make the systems testable as long as they are simple.
