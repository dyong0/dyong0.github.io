Do you think that you can accumulate numbers sequentially from 1 to 1000 without any error? You might say yes, but I never do. The calculation gives me 1000 chances of making a mistake. 1 + 2 = 3, 3 + 4 = 7, 7 + 5 = 12, and so on. Even if I finish calculating the accumulation, I can't say that the answer is correct. Because I don't have any proof to show.

Let's bring this heavy calculation to the real life. Suppose you're under a cruel pressure where you should never make mistakes, surrounded by the full of unexpected things. You might lose confidence, and you also won't be proactive.

Human error always occurs even with being super careful. Blaming people who take responsibilities can't be any solution for this problem. The correct way to prevent human error is adopting a system that can be entirely trusted.

Reliable systems are built on tests, which detect unexpected behaviors and changes. And you can make the systems testable as long as they are simple.
