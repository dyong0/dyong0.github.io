Do you think that you can accumulate numbers from 1 to 1000 sequentially without any error? You might say yes, but I never do. The calculation gives me 1000 times of chances of making a mistake. 1 + 2 = 3, 3 + 4 = 7, 7 + 5 = 12, and so on. Even if I finish calculating the accumulation somehow, I can't say that the answer is correct. I don't have any proof to show.

Let's bring this heavy calculation to our real life. You're under the cruel pressure where you should never make mistakes but surrounded by the full of unexpected things. You might lose confidence, and also you won't be proactive.

Human errors always happen even with being super careful. Blaming people who take responsibilities can't be any solution for this problem. The correct way to prevent human errors is adopting a system that can be entirely trusted.

Reliable systems are built on tests, which detect unexpected behaviors and changes. And also you can make the systems testable as long as they are simple.
