title : Why I wanted to work for a global company
---

I'm Korean and worked for about 3 years in my country. And I had never worked with foreigners when I was in Korea. However, I could hear the cultures of global companies. For example, they don't have unnecessary hierarchical organizations.

Since my career has been started when I was doing my military service, I thought that working as my superiors order and say to me was correct enough. Besides, people who lived in the age that I lived learned that we have to obey our superiors. So it was too natural to imagine that I would disobey my superiors.

But I realized that I don't need to follow the superiors and could make reasonable excuses, once I had a few talks with some guys working in the US. I saw a hope, and wished that I would work for a good company where I can be confident with myself.
