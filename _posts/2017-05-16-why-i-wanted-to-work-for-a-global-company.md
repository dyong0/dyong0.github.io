title : Why I wanted to work for a global company
---

I'm Korean and worked for about 3 years in my country. And I had never worked with foreigners. However, I could hear some cultures of global companies.

Since my career has been started when I was doing my military service, I thought that working as my superiors order and say to me was correct. Besides, people who lived in the ages that I lived learned that we have to obey our superiors. So it was too natural to imagine that I would disobey my superiors.

But I realized that I don't need to follow the superiors and could make reasonable excuses, when I had a few talks with some Korean guys working for a global company in the US. I saw a hope, and wished that I would work for a global company where I can be satisfied with my life.
