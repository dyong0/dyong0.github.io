title : Why I wanted to work for a global company
---

I'm Korean who have worked for about 3 years in my country. And I had never worked with foreigners before. However, I could hear the culture in global companies.

Since my career started when I was doing my military service, I thought that working as my superiors order was always correct. Besides, my peers were taught that we have to obey our superiors. It was too natural for me, as a result, even I couldn't imagine that I would disobey my superiors.

I once had a few conversations with some Korean guys working for a global company in the US. From the conversations, I realized that I don't need to follow them and I could make reasonable excuses. I saw hope, and wished that I would work for a global company where I can be satisfied with my life.
