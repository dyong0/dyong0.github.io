title : Deciding objectively
---

Recently I watched a video about making a decision objectively. I linked this video on the bottom of this post. The guy in this video speaks Korean though. Anyway, let me explain how it works.

<!--break-->

Basically this is making a decision based on some factors you matter. First draw a table with a header row, which has Criteria, Weight, Option 1, Option 2, Option N, Score of Option 1, Result of Option 2, and so on.

**Vacation plan**

Criteria | Weight | Company A | Company B | Score of Company A | Score of Company B
         |        |           |

And then, list up factors you matter on the first column and in following rows. 

Criteria            | Weight | Company A | Company B | Score of Company A | Score of Company B
Salary              |        |           |
Workplace           |        |           |
Opportunity to grow |        |           |
Overwork            |        |           |
Members             |        |           |

Once finished listing factors, put weight for each criteria.

Criteria            | Weight | Company A | Company B | Score of Company A | Score of Company B
Salary              | 4      |           |
Workplace           | 2      |           |
Opportunity to grow | 2      |           |
Overwork            | 3      |           |
Members             | 5      |           |

Add scores of each option to correspoding criteria. The scores should be relative to each option. I recommend you have same values on the first option.

Criteria            | Weight | Company A | Company B | Score of Company A | Score of Company B
Salary              | 4 | 100  | 120
Workplace           | 2 | 100  | 110
Opportunity to grow | 2 | 100  | 80
Overwork            | 3 | -100 | -50
Members             | 5 | 100  | 95

To get the first decision, we need to calculate scores by multiplying each score and corresponding weight.

Criteria            | Weight | Company A | Company B | Score of Company A | Score of Company B
Salary              | 4      | 100       | 120       | 400                | 480
Workplace           | 2      | 100       | 110       | 200                | 220
Opportunity to grow | 2      | 100       | 80        | 200                | 160
Overwork            | 3      | -100      | -50       | -300               | -150
Members             | 5      | 100       | 95        | 500                | 475

So the total score of Company A is `1000`, while B results in `1185`. Slightly, Company B won. But you might not be satisfied with this result. Of course, you can adjust the weight you set like this:


Criteria            | Weight | Company A | Company B | Score of Company A | Score of Company B
Salary              | 3.5    | 100       | 120       | 350                | 420
Workplace           | 2      | 100       | 110       | 200                | 220
Opportunity to grow | 2.5    | 100       | 80        | 250                | 200
Overwork            | 3      | -100      | -50       | -300               | -150
Members             | 5      | 100       | 95        | 500                | 475

Company A still got `1000` and Company B got `1165` less than the previous score `1185`. This means your mind is on company B. But still you might be doubting the result. To make your decision more objective, you can be more strict on the score of Company B. Try giving less score on Company B. If the score of Company B is still quite more than the one of Company A, the decision is set on Company B. Let's see:

Criteria            | Weight | Company A | Company B | Score of Company A | Score of Company B
Salary              | 3.5    | 100       | 120       | 350                | 420
Workplace           | 2      | 100       | 105       | 200                | 210
Opportunity to grow | 2.5    | 100       | 75        | 250                | 187.5
Overwork            | 3      | -100      | -65       | -300               | -195
Members             | 5      | 100       | 95        | 500                | 475

Company B got `1097.5`. You're still on Company B. If you still feel doubtful on the result, try again over again until you get confident. You can also ask your friends that this decision looks unbiased, so that making this decision clearer.
