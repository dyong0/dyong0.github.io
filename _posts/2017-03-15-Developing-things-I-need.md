title : Developing things I need
---

Just a few days ago, I had a problem on a vim plugin that I had used. It was consuming too much IO resources on my laptop. I googled this problem for a while but I couldn't get any question or answer related to this problem. So I started to investigate it by looking inside the source code of the plugin. And I found out that there's no option to disable running this plugin under specific directories.

<!--break-->

Naturally, I added the feature on the plugin with a few functions, which could blow away the problem. And I posted the issue and its solution that I made on the source code repository.

From these steps, I've was satisfied with my accomplishment while hoping that it would help others as well. I really understood the core fun in developing things I need. Whenever I code on personal work, it makes me keep loving programming and recognizing what I truly like. I'm very lucky.
