Misunderstanding happens due to several reasons. Regardless of the reasons, people like to blame the consequnces on misunderstanding. Of course, also people look for something or someone to be blamed.

I often try to be objective with myself, admitting my faults. At least as an engineer, I think this attitude is one of the keys that improve myself continuously. But it never mean that others are like me. Some of them feel embarrassed for making mistakes, and also tend to hide the problems they made rather than fix them.

Although it's obviously easy to show that they made problems, lots of people just ignore them. They don't want to make annoying sounds. I don't either want to make problems in this atmosphere. The air is too stuck already to argue.
