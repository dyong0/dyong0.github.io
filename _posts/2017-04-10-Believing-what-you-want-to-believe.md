Misunderstanding happens due to several causes. Regardless of reasons, people like to blame the consequnces of misunderstanding. Of course also, people look for something or someone to be blamed.

I like to be objective to myself, admitting my faults so that becoming better. At least as an engineer, I think this attitude is one of the keys that improves myself continuously. But there are people not like me. These guys feel embarrassed by making mistakes, and also tend to hide the problems they made rather than fix them.

Well it's obviously easy to show that they made problems though, a lot of people just ignore the issues, kicking something to reduce the stresses coming from. Me either don't want to make problems in this atmosphere. It's too stuck already.
