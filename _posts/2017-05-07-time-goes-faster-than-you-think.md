If we have a specific deadline, we try to meet the deadline. In most cases, somehow we finish assignments in the end. In contrast, without any due dates, we love to say *"I don't feel to do that, just later."* Basically the someday-works are often unplanned, because they are not urgent, and we think that we have enough time to deal with them, comparing our lifespan. But this it not true, we might not have enough time to achieve our wishes.

Let's have a simple calculation. I'm 27 and I might live until around 80, so I have 53 years left now. 53 years equal 636 months. Do you think the number 636 looks big enough for your life? There's a real deadline in everyone's life, we need to think about it.
