I often put off tasks that I planned at home. I thought that being lazy is just a trivial problem that I have, and I've seen a lot of people who are likely to be indiligent. But recently I also found the people who think laziness is one of the most fatal problems that they have.

If we have a specific deadline, we try to meet it. In most cases, we somehow finish the tasks with due dates in time. In contrast, without any deadlines, we love to say *"I don't feel like doing that, I'll do it later."* Furthermore, a plan without a due date such as "traveling around world in 3 months" is often unplanned, because it's not urgent. And also we feel that we have enough time to execute plan while making an excuse. But, in fact, our lifespan might not be so long for achieving our goals.

Let's make a simple calculation. I'm 27 and I'd probably live until 80, so I have 53 years left now. 53 years equals 636 months. Do you think the number 636 looks big enough to describe the rest of 27's life? No I don't think so. There's an obviously real deadline in everyone's life, we need to think about it.
