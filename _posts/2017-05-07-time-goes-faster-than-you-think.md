I often put off tasks that I planned at home. I thought that being lazy is just a trivial problem that I have, and I've seen a lot of people who are likely to be indiligent as gravity pulls us down. But recently I also found the people who think laziness is one of the most fatal problem that they have.

If we have a specific deadline, we try to meet it. In most cases, we somehow finish the tasks with due dates in the end. In contrast, without any deadlines, we love to say *"I don't feel like doing that, I'll do that later."* Furthermore, a plan without a due such as "traveling around world in 3 months" is often unplanned, because it's not urgent. And also we feel that we have enough time to deal with the plan while making an excuse. But, in fact, we might not have enough time to achieve our goals.

Let's make a simple calculation. I'm 27 and I'd probably live until 80, so I have 53 years left now. 53 years equals 636 months. Do you think the number 636 looks big enough to describe 27's left life? No I don't think so. There's an obviously real deadline in everyone's life, we need to think about it.
