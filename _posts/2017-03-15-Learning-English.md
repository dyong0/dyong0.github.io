title : Learning English
---

In the beginning of my life overseas, I only could say very few expressions. I had an interview outside of my country using English. Somehow I managed to show my eagerness and professionality to the interviewers. I memorized expressions and words that I could take advantages of while answering the questions before the interview. By the time I rarely had talks in English in my life. It was completely challenging.

Anyway, I'm using English as the main at the current job, even though still not good at speaking in English. But I've learned it since I was the 3rd grade in elementary school. Basically I should have been able to speak in English.

Once I realized that I wanted to express my thoughts in English when I'm coding, since it was more natural than writing the code in Korean. So coding in English but thinking in Korean was like walking on your arms.

Currently I've been studying English in patience. Trying to be natural while thinking in English even when I'm home. English lessons via Skype also have helped me so much. Keep learning.
