title : Learning English
---

In the beginning of my life overseas, I only could say very few expressions. Somehow I hardly managed to show my enthusiasm and professionalities to the interviewers with them. I prepared some expected questions and memorized expressions as well as words that I could take advantages of. By the time I rarely had talks in English out of school. It was literally challenging.

Anyway I'm using English as main language at our office though, I'm not that good at speaking English. But I've learned it since I was the 3rd grade in elementary school. Basically I should have supposed to focus on tests instead of using practical English. I've never thought that I would talk to foreign people. I insisted that I'm Korean and Korean was enough to me.

Once I realized that I wanted to use English at least when I'm coding. Korean has almost opposite order in its grammar to English. So coding in English but thinking in Korean was like walking on your arms as filpped. All logics were following the flow of English, showing the most important things such as verbs, then the details go.

Currently I've been studying English in patience. Trying to be natural on thinking in English even when I'm home alone. English lessons via Skype also have helped me so much. Keep doing them.
