I watched this video clip about a tech presentation held in F8 2017, Facebook Developer Conference. It was a such amazing breakthrough. Currently we have tons of various languages. Sometimes we also use sign languages to represent the current language systems. Facebook brought a new method to communicate, which is entirely silent but directly through your mind.

The basic idea under the technology is that we translate electric signals generated in our brains into an intermediate language. And the intermediate language is mapped to our actual languages we speak. Although it's not an astonishing idea, but it seems achievable nowadays. Because Facebook might have enough lingual data personalized, but also a huge budget to invest on the tech as water falls. Furthermore, they do know Deep learning and Machine learning. These 2 techs will lead Facebook realize the idea.

I've seen that technologies will definitely change our lives in around 15 years, 2030 at most. This is one of the changes coming soon. Let's look forward new future.
