I watched this video clip about a tech presentation held in F8 2017, Facebook Developer Conference. It was a such amazing breakthrough. Currently we have a lot of various languages. Sometimes we also use sign languages to represent the current languages. Facebook brought a new method to communicate, which is entirely silent and comes directly through your mind.

The basic idea behind the technology is that electric signals generated in our brains can be translated into an intermediate language. And the intermediate language is mapped to actual languages we speak. Although it's not an astonishing idea, it seems achievable nowadays. Not only does Facebook have plenty of lingual data personalized, but it also has a huge budget to invest on the tech as water falls. Furthermore, they are one of the tech leaders in Deep learning and Machine learning. These 2 techs will lead Facebook to realize the idea.

I feel that technologies will definitely change our lives in about 15 years, around 2030 at most. And this is one of the changes coming soon. Let's look forward to the new future.
