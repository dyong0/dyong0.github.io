title : Myth of coding tests
---

Software engineers take coding tests when they apply for a job. Coding test is a good tool for screening engineers who are unfamiliar with coding. However, coding tests are sometimes misused.

 Senior engineers are often asked to solve basic programming problems such as implementing Quick sort. I think that any qualified software engineers can solve those basic problems, if they still remember how the problems work at the moment. I've seen more people who don't remember specific solutions of the programming problems than who are really good at memorizing the solutions.
 
 Due to this reason, some companies have been hiring software engineers without coding tests. In addition, if you'd like to figure out who is really good at programming, you should try coding with the interviewers, so that you can see how logically they think and how good they are at required skills.
