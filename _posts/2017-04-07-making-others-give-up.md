title : Making others give up
---

People with authoirty are likely to be stubborn. I read an article about how people with authority think differently from the others subordinate. Probably you also felt this in some of groups such as family, school, or work. 

<!--break-->

The authoirty guys often take huge responsibilities. They don't like changes even in good way for mankind, because a new thing means a new responsibility to them. As a result, they stand by their authorities, and push the powerless by stepping over corpses.

But we can fight against these authorities as we've done in our democratic society. We don't need to be just naive lambs. I suggest you be bold.
