People with authority are likely to be stubborn. I read an article about how people with authority think differently from their subordinates. Probably you also felt this in some of groups such as family, school, or work.

The authority guys often take huge responsibilities. They don't like changes even in good way for mankind, because a new thing means a new responsibility to them. As a result, they stand by their authorities, and push the powerless by stepping over corpses.
