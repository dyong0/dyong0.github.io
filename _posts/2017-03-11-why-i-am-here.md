title : Why I am here
---

I want to live peacefully, friendly, and in honest.

The story goes back to the beginning of my life. I was born in Korea so Korean, living in the society depressing, deceiving, and aggressive. The people with power tend to decline their bad and so easily accepted in public. Lower people barely have managed to survive in this society by sacrificing others. Even more these days we're calling our country Korea Hell, which is decorating hell with Korea because people think hell is a much nicer place than Korea.

Actually I never thought that I would go overseas to live and work. Because I was proud of living in my country without any doubts. I've been tought like that. But I didn't want to live in the society of no hope. Once I just realized that I'd lived for surviving. Only that, and I knew that we could do better, I could do better at least. So I decided to go out from this hell.

I started my another life by myself. I left behind my family and friends. They might lose me from their world and so do I from my world. I had thought this kind of isolation would never happen again since I finished my military service, which took 2 years of my precious time. It became real anyway.

In short, I'm living in another country now, feeling satisfied with living and working here. But I won't stop finding better places. Plus, I hope that whoever wonders going out like me would try living in other countries. Good luck.
