title : Asking and answering by myself
---

Since a few days ago, I've been reading a book called [Effective Programming: More Than Writing Code](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15746409-effective-programming). One of the most impressive things was finding solutions for a problem by myself. I think that this idea is general but useful enough as we can take advantage of it in our everyday lives.

First of all, we often don't know what we want to know. For example, a guy wanted to learn painting. He just googled how to paint and tried some tutorials. However, 6 months passed, he still didn't feel that his painting got better. In this story, the guy wanted to learn painting, but he didn't know what he wanted to paint. He jumped too far, ignoring essential steps.

Before starting a plan, examine everything about the plan. If you don't feel confident with being detailed, just write them down. This practice will let you know what you don't understand. In addition, I apply this good practice to make better answers. Whenever I'm asked a question, I ask it back in order to get the core meaning from the questioner. It's the same principle.

About the book I mentioned at the beginning, it says that the author got a problem, so he wrote a draft of the question on a Q&A community. However the questioner couldn't finish writing it, since he realized that not only his question was unreasonable, but also the problem was wrong itself. As a result, he started to find solutions for the problem from the scratch, and finally he could make a good answer for the problem.
