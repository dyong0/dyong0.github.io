title : Asking and answering by myself
---

Since few days ago, I've been reading a book called [Effective Programming: More Than Writing Code](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15746409-effective-programming). One of the most impressive things was finding solutions of a problem by myself. I think that this idea is general but as useful enough as we can take advantage of it in our everyday life.

First of all, we usually don't know what we want to know. For example, a guy wanted to learn painting. He just googled how to paint and tried some tutorials. However, 6 months past, he still didn't feel improved. In this example, the guy wanted to learn painting, but he didn't know what he wanted to paint. He jumped too far, ignoring essential steps.

Before starting a plan, ask yourself and try to make an answer by yourself. If you feel not confident with answering, write down the things you're not sure with. And then, try to be detailed as much as possible. It will let you know what you don't understand. Following these steps, you can know what you want to know exactly and what you don't know. You can make the plan reasonable, and also it will significantly reduce the chance of missing things to keep.


The following is the part of the book mentioned on the top. Last 2 paragraphs were talking about an application of the idea from this quote.

> I don’t know how many times this has happened:
>
> - I have a problem
> - I decide to bring it to stack overflow (Q&A community)
> - I awkwardly write down my question
> - I realize that the question doesn’t make any sense
> - I take 15 minutes to rethink how to ask my question
> - I realize that I’m attacking the problem from a wrong direction entirely
> - I start from scratch and find my solution quickly
>
> Does this happen to you? Sometimes asking the right question seems like half the problem

Whenever I'm asked some questions, I ask the questions back to get the genuine question. It's the same principle. Ask yourself to understand your actual questions.
