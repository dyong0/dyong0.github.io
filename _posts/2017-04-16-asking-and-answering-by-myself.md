title : Asking and answering by myself
---

Since few days ago, I've been reading a book called [Effective Programming: More Than Writing Code](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15746409-effective-programming). One of the most impressive things was finding solutions about a problem by myself. I think that this idea is general but very useful, so that we can use it in our everyday life.

First of all, we don't know what we want to exactly know. Do you agree with it? Let's see an example. John wants to learn painting. He just googles how to paint and tries some tutorials. However, 6 months past, he still doesn't feel improved. In this example, John wanted to learn painting but he didn't know what he wanted to paint. Seems a famiiliar story right?

The key is very simple. Ask yourself first, so that you understand what you know and don't. After asking yourself, if you could understand the question and answer properely, you're ready to ask the question to someone. If not, you don't know what you want obviously.

I quote a part of the book.
> I don’t know how many times this has happened:
> - I have a problem
> - I decide to bring it to stack overflow (Q&A community)
> - I awkwardly write down my question
> - I realize that the question doesn’t make any sense
> - I take 15 minutes to rethink how to ask my question
> - I realize that I’m attacking the problem from a wrong direction entirely
> - I start from scratch and find my solution quickly
>
> Does this happen to you? Sometimes asking the right question seems like half the problem

Whenever I'm asked some questions, I ask them back to understand the genuine question. It's the same principle. Asking yourself is understanding your actual questions. Have a try.
