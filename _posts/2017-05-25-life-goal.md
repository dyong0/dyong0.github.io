I live for being happy. Generally I haven't feel good, and sometimes I blamed my life without any reason. A few days ago, I seriously thought about why I'm unhappy and never be satisfied.

The reason was that I've been tired of my competitive everyday. Even when taking a rest, I could feel heavy pressure. My life was mean but tough: school, school, school, military service, and work. On every single step of my life, I fought myself to get better in the next step. But now I don't need to keep fighting. I can take a rest whenever I can take the responsibility. In short, I got freedom.

I realized that I'm satisfied with the current situation, and also I could notice that I'm feeling happy now. Even it's a little bit awkward for me, because this feeling is very new to me. Since I know that I can decide how to live from now on, probably I will be much happier.
