I live for being happy. Generally I haven't feel happy, and sometimes I blamed my life without any reason. A few days ago, I seriously thought about why I'm unhappy and never be satisfied.

The reason was that I've been tired of my competitive everyday. Even when I took a rest, I could feel heavy pressure. My life was very mean but tough: school, school, school, military service, and work. On every single step of my life, I fought myself to get better in the next step. But now I don't need to keep fighting. I can take a rest whenever I can take the responsibility. In short, I got freedom.

I realized that I'm satisfied with the current life and happy now. Yet I feel a little bit awkward, because this feeling is enlightenment to me. Since I know that I can decide how to walk forward in my life from now on, probably I can be happier.
