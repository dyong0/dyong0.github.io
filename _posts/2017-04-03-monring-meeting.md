title : Morning meeting
---

Since I got the current job, I've had morning meetings. They're mostly team-wide, and company-wide once a week. I think they're rarely useful.

First, we never share the important things we should make sound from our voice. But almost every time, we just read our schedule. Even in the company wide meetings, only business results are shared. We're not investors. These are just eating off our time, making people apparently unproductive.

Second, the useless meetings force us to be punctual on the most crowded time, taking our precious time. It makes people to work harder in bad way.

Last, no communication happens that supposed to happen. It's because people know these are useless and not interesting.
