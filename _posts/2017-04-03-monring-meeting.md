title : Morning meeting
---

Since I joined this company that I'm working for, I've been having morning meetings. They're mostly handled as in my team, but once a week companywide. I think they're rarely useful.

First, we never share the important things we should announce from our voice. But almost every time, we just read our schedules. Even in the companywide meetings, only business results are shared. We're not investors though. These are just eating off our time, making people apparently unproductive.

Second, the useless meetings force us to be punctual on the most crowded time, taking our precious time. It makes people to work harder in bad way.

Last, no communication happens that supposed to happen though. It's because people know these are useless and not interesting.
