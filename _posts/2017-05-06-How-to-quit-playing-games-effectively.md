title : How to quit playing games effectively
---

I've been playing games about for 20 years. Games have affected my whole life both in good and bad ways. I wanted to create a game, so I became a programmer, but I'm currently working on web programming. Meanwhile, I've spent too much time on playing games. I should have kept away from it, so I've tried several ways to quit games.

I tried uninstalling games, deleting my accounts of them, and having other hobbies. But they all didn't work for me, because I still had the possibility of getting back to play games.

The key to quit playing games is understanding your laziness. I uninstalled Windows, as a result, I need to setup my PC from the scratch if I really want to play games, which takes me at least 10 hours. This way tested my laziness seriously, and I got used to doing something different instead of games. My laziness won.
