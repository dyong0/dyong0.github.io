title : How to quit playing games effectively
---

I started to play games since I was about 5. I also started programming as I wanted to make a game. Games have affected my whole life so much. Realizing that I spent too much time on playing games, I've been trying to quit wasting time on games.

I tried a lot of ways to stop playing games such as uninstalling them, deleting my accounts on games, having other hobbies. But the most effective way was getting rid of machines running games, so that I got used to doing something different in my free time. Physically prevent it, this method will test your laziness. If you're lazy enough, it should work for you. I'm lazy enough.
