title : How to quit playing games effectively
---

It's been for about 20 years since I started to play games. Games have affected my whole life both in good and bad ways. I wanted to create a game. So I became a programmer, even though working on web programming. Meanwhile, I've spent too much time on playing games in my free time. I failed to control myself. I've tried several ways to quit it.

Getting out of games temporaily in short term didn't work for me, such as uninstalling them, deleting my accounts on games, and having other hobbies. I had my PC and could get back to play games, in other words, I was still ready to play games.

The key to quit playing games is understanding your laziness. I got rid of my PC. To play games again, I have to buy a new gaming machine. This method made me think of the cost of buying new one seriously. During the time with no game, I got used enough to doing something different in my free time. My laziness won. I didn't buy the gaming machine.
