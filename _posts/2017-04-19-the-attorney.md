title : The Attorney
---

There will be an election for new president in Korea soon. This election is basically unplanned since our democracy impeached the president few month ago. The president had been suspected with several charges such as using her power to make private property.

The Attorney is a movie inspired by a real story in 1980s. The movie shows how our government deceived and tortured civilians. In this movie, some students were teaching themselves History and Democracy in a small shabby class room. Suddenly some guys in black suit invaded the class, and forcefully arrested the students. They were torturing awful ways, since the students were suspected that they have learned Communism, and also tried to conduct a anti-democratic revolution. But the truth was so far from that suspicion.

An attorney, who had known one of the students, jumped in the charge of the students. However it ended as the students were still guilty, although the attorney proved their innocence. I was so sad of this ending, because it's the real story. In addition, this story is still on going, happening everywhere in Korea. As we accomplished justice few month ago since we built the independent government, we will keep fighting against these evils to get back the rights we've lost.
