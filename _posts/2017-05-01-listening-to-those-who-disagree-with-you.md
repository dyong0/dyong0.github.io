title : Listening to those who disagree with you
---

There are a lot of different people. 5 of 10 wouldn't care about you. 3 of 10 would dislike you. And 2 of 10 would really love you. The portion might be wrong. But the important thing is that there are more people who think different with you than who have the same views as yours.

I would like to be calm when I get opinions entirely against my thoughts. Because I would meet those people thinking different with me, and they're not wrong. I won't cut their words by listening to their voice carefully, and accept their opinions.
