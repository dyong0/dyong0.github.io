There are a lot of different people. 5 out of 10 wouldn't care about you. 3 out of 10 would dislike you. And 2 out of 10 would really love you. The ratio might be wrong. But the important thing is that there are more people who think differently from you than who have the same views as yours.

I think that I need to admit the facts mentioned. So I would like to stay calm when I hear opinions that are entirely against mine. Because I would meet those people who think differently from me, and they're not wrong. I won't interrupt them and accept their opinions.
