I watched Mars: TV miniseries. The story is based on fiction going Mars and living there. In the middle of scean, it shows some documentaries mostly related to a space project by Elon Musk. The project is called SpaceX, which is for finding a new habitat out of Earth.

I was astonished by the project objective and how he thinks. As I've seen fights between people in the small societies, I never thought others would be walking forward to the space so proactively like that.

I'm really feeling grateful of the TV series. Thank you National Geography.
