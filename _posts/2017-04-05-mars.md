I watched Mars: TV miniseries. This is a fictional story about going Mars and living there. It also has some documentaries during the scenes. They are mostly related to a space project by Elon Musk. The project is called SpaceX and its objective is finding a new habitat out of the planet earth.

I was astonished by the project. I saw an experiment where a space craft was launched as high as almost satellite orbit level, then landed on the ground without any damage. I just thought someday we could travel space like we travel other countries by plane.

Meanwhile I also felt sad, thinking of my country. We've been fighting each other for rights. But still our society is so corrupted and we should keep the fights. I wish we would have a chance to discuss mankind problems beyond our society's.

I'm really feeling grateful of the TV series. Thank you National Geography.
