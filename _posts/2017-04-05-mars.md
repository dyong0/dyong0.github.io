I watched Mars: TV miniseries. This is a fictional story about going Mars and living there. It also has some documentaries during the scenes. They are mostly related to a space project by Elon Musk. The project is called SpaceX and its objective is finding a new habitat out of the planet earth.

I was astonished by the project. I saw an experiment where a space craft was launched almost as high as satellite orbit level, then landed on the ground without any damage. Someday we might travel space easily like we go to other countries by plane.

In contrast to the surprise, I also felt sad, thinking of my country. We've been fighting each other and against the corrupted authorities for rights. But still our society is corrupt, we should keep fighting. I wish we would have a chance to discuss mankind problems beyond our society's issues.

I'm really feeling grateful of the TV series. Thank you National Geography.
